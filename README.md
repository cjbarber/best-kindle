Takeaways:

 - If you think you want a bigger screen (i.e. >6"), but you want it for reading, change your expectations or don't get a Kindle. Also worth noting that you can change the font size on the Kindle to make it easier to read.
 - Reading many PDFs, graphic novels and comics? Get a tablet instead (e.g. iPad, or Nexus). Thanks /u/mvmntsofthemind
 - Reading technical PDFs that need a larger screen? Get a tablet instead, or a Kindle DX. Thanks /u/fathermocker and /u/pa-guy
 - Kindle Paperwhite advantages: doesn't hurt your eyes
 - Tip: Calibre is great for transferring .mobi files to the Kindle

 Takeaways:
 
  - Questions people ask: Can I read outdoors with the paperwhite? How is the screen quality and responsiveness? Can I save/highlight phrases/paragraphs/sentences? Can I define words? Can I define words without an internet connection? Can I buy books on the Kindle? 
  - Kindle Paperwhite seems almost universally the best choice so far if reading is the primary focus.

Date: December 8, 2013

Takeaways:

 - Get it with special offers (ads). Save $20 now, and you can pay to remove the ads at any point later in time if you don't like them (same cost). Thanks /u/yargdpirate
 - You probably don't need the 3G version. Worst case, stock up on books when on WiFi, or tether your phone and create a WiFi network to connect to. Thanks /u/Stevied1991
 - If you want to, you can switch WiFi off after registering and setting up, and then it will stop the Kindle from downloading new ads (the loaded ones will last for around 2 weeks). Also, the battery will last longer. Thanks /u/deruch
 - "I paid the $20 to get rid of the ads, and wish I'd done it sooner. Without ads, the kindle auto unlocks when you open the cover on your smart case. With ads, you open the cover of your case and then have to swipe the screen to start reading. It's well worth the $20 to me to be able to get right to reading." Thanks /u/theMooch

 - [This](http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-Leather-Cover/dp/B007R5YFS4/) is a great case for the Paperwhite. Thanks /u/essentialfloss and /u/Stevied1991

Date: November 28, 2013

Takeaways:

 - Want to watch movies and browse the web occasionally too? Then a Fire is a reasonable choice (if you are an advid reader - otherwise maybe consider getting a regular tablet + a Kindle Paperwhite)
 - "If you like to break off from reading to check your emails, play Candy Crush Saga or see what's happening on Facebook, get the Fire. But if you're thinking of getting a tablet, you might as well consider a Nexus 7 or any other: you can install the Kindle app and other Amazon apps on any Android device and have access to the Google Play store. With the Fire you have to use the Amazon App store instead. The Kindle Fire is deliberately nobbled compared to other tablets, so that you are obliged to get everything from Amazon, but if you like getting your books, apps and MP3s from Amazon, that won't be a problem for you." When to get the Kindle Fire - from /u/\_njd\_
 - "If you love reading, get an e-ink Kindle like the Paperwhite. The screen's better for reading, doesn't suffer glare, and the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours." /u/\_njd\_

Takeaways:

 - Wants: Not a tablet! They realized they can use their laptop for that. Wants something to read on.
 - Questions: Older model or current one? Should I get a 3G Kindle if I don't have WiFi at home? Can I transfer books from a computer without WiFi? (Yes)
 - Don't want to spend $119? The basic Kindle at $69 is still a good option, the main drawback is the lack of a backlit screen which makes reading in low light harder. /u/perkited

 - Get the 3G Kindle if you travel a *lot* without WiFi. /u/shortbaldman

 - Must have audiobooks? Then get the Kindle Keyboard. Otherwise, Paperwhite. /u/lordeddardstark
 - Note: the Kindle Keyboard doesn't seem that well regarded. If you must have audiobooks, my sense is that the optimal solution would be to use your phone for audiobooks, and still get the Paperwhite.
