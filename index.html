<p>By Chris Barber</p>

<h3>
<a name="questions" class="anchor" href="#questions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Questions</h3>

<p>Are you just using it for reading? Kindle Paperwhite.</p>

<p>Can you not afford the Paperwhite? Get a generic ereader, or if you won't be reading in any low-light situations, get the basic Kindle.</p>

<p>Want a bigger screen? Get an iPad or Nexus 7.</p>

<p>Reading mostly PDFs, graphic novels, comic books, or manga? Get an iPad or Nexus 7, or the Kobo Aura HD.</p>

<p>Travel a lot and want to download new books? Get the 3G. Otherwise, you probably don't need it.</p>

<p>Do you want to break from reading and play games or check Facebook? Then get a Fire. However, the Fire isn't extremely well regarded, and you may as well get an iPad or Nexus 7 and just install the Kindle app.</p>

<p>Notes on the Paperwhite.</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, you can read outdoors.</li>
<li>You can easily highlight and save sentences.</li>
<li>You can define words without an internet connection.</li>
<li>Get it with special offers, save $20, and you can pay $20 to get rid of the ads at any time if you wish.</li>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-Leather-Cover/dp/B007R5YFS4/">This</a> is a great case for the Paperwhite. Thanks /u/essentialfloss and /u/Stevied1991</li>
</ul><p>Quotes on the Paperwhite:</p>

<ul>
<li>"As everyone else has said, if all you want to do is read, get a Paperwhite. It's the best e-reader on the market. I've had one for a bit more than a year and absolutely love it." /u/admiraljohn</li>
<li>"... Another vote for the Paperwhite. It's brilliant! Reading in the dark doesn't strain my eyes because of the backlight." /u/deniably</li>

<p>Date: April 21, 2014</p>

<p>Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you think you want a bigger screen (i.e. &gt;6"), but you want it for reading, change your expectations or don't get a Kindle. Also worth noting that you can change the font size on the Kindle to make it easier to read.</li>
<li>Reading many PDFs, graphic novels and comics? Get a tablet instead (e.g. iPad, or Nexus). Thanks /u/mvmntsofthemind</li>
<li>Reading technical PDFs that need a larger screen? Get a tablet instead, or a Kindle DX. Thanks /u/fathermocker and /u/pa-guy</li>
<li>Kindle Paperwhite advantages: doesn't hurt your eyes</li>
<li>Tip: Calibre is great for transferring .mobi files to the Kindle</li>

<p>Date: March 18, 2014</p>

<p>Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Questions people ask: Can I read outdoors with the paperwhite? How is the screen quality and responsiveness? Can I save/highlight phrases/paragraphs/sentences? Can I define words? Can I define words without an internet connection? Can I buy books on the Kindle? </li>
<li>Kindle Paperwhite seems almost universally the best choice so far if reading is the primary focus.</li>

<p>Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>For comic books/manga/graphic novels, check out the Kobo Aura HD. /u/AcidWeb</li>
<li>Wants: to read books in a normally lit room. Doesn't need wifi, touch, huge memory, etc.</li>

<p>Date: December 8, 2013</p>

<p>Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get it with special offers (ads). Save $20 now, and you can pay to remove the ads at any point later in time if you don't like them (same cost). Thanks /u/yargdpirate</li>
<li>You probably don't need the 3G version. Worst case, stock up on books when on WiFi, or tether your phone and create a WiFi network to connect to. Thanks /u/Stevied1991</li>
<li>If you want to, you can switch WiFi off after registering and setting up, and then it will stop the Kindle from downloading new ads (the loaded ones will last for around 2 weeks). Also, the battery will last longer. Thanks /u/deruch</li>
<li>"I paid the $20 to get rid of the ads, and wish I'd done it sooner. Without ads, the kindle auto unlocks when you open the cover on your smart case. With ads, you open the cover of your case and then have to swipe the screen to start reading. It's well worth the $20 to me to be able to get right to reading." Thanks /u/theMooch</li>

<p>Takeaways:</p>

<li>Reading? Get the Paperwhite.</li>
<li>"The Paperwhite is like reading a real printed piece of paper. The Fire is like every other LCD computer display you've ever seen." Thanks /u/DublinBen</li>
<li>Just want a tablet? The Fire may not be the best choice, consider a Nexus 7 or iPad. /u/DublinBen</li>
<li>"For standard books, Paper white wins easily." /u/vanker</li>

<p>Date: November 28, 2013</p>

<p>Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Want to watch movies and browse the web occasionally too? Then a Fire is a reasonable choice (if you are an advid reader - otherwise maybe consider getting a regular tablet + a Kindle Paperwhite)</li>
<li>"If you like to break off from reading to check your emails, play Candy Crush Saga or see what's happening on Facebook, get the Fire. But if you're thinking of getting a tablet, you might as well consider a Nexus 7 or any other: you can install the Kindle app and other Amazon apps on any Android device and have access to the Google Play store. With the Fire you have to use the Amazon App store instead. The Kindle Fire is deliberately nobbled compared to other tablets, so that you are obliged to get everything from Amazon, but if you like getting your books, apps and MP3s from Amazon, that won't be a problem for you." When to get the Kindle Fire - from /u/_njd_</li>
<li>"If you love reading, get an e-ink Kindle like the Paperwhite. The screen's better for reading, doesn't suffer glare, and the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours." /u/_njd_</li>

<p>Date: November 24, 2013</p>

<p>Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wants: Not a tablet! They realized they can use their laptop for that. Wants something to read on.</li>
<li>Questions: Older model or current one? Should I get a 3G Kindle if I don't have WiFi at home? Can I transfer books from a computer without WiFi? (Yes)</li>
<li>Don't want to spend $119? The basic Kindle at $69 is still a good option, the main drawback is the lack of a backlit screen which makes reading in low light harder. /u/perkited</li>

<p>Date: October 16, 2013</p>

<p>Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Want the latest model and not super price sensitive? Get the HDX. Price sensitive? Get the HD (or a different tablet).</li>
